# Rhythm regularity

Data & code for the paper *Measuring Rhythm Regularity in Verse: Entropy of Inter-Stress Intervals*  


Notebook can be accessed directly from github here `rhythm_regularity_notebook.md`. It holds both data prep and analysis, however:

**DISCLAIMER**. RNC is not an open corpus, so we cannot provide it here and use derived data in the analysis. We demonstrate our handling of corpus and sampling strategy, but the code in the **Data preparation** section of the notebook is not executable autonomously. Go directly to **Rhythm entropy** for fully reproducible analysis.
